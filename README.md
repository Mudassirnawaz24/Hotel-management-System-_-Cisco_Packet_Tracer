# Hotel Management System - Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates a simulated **Hotel Management System network infrastructure** built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The setup emulates a real-world network for a hotel, including routers, switches, end devices, servers, and wireless connectivity for secure and efficient operations.

## 🏨 Project Overview

The Hotel Management System includes a detailed network topology that supports:
- Multiple floors/rooms with IP addressing
- Centralized server management (DNS, DHCP, Web, FTP)
- Admin and guest networks
- Wireless access point for guests
- VLANs for segmentation (Admin, Reception, Guest)
- Secure routing between segments

This simulation aims to provide a smart, secure, and scalable networking solution suitable for medium to large-scale hotels.

## 🧱 Features

- ✅ DNS, DHCP, and Web Server Configuration
- ✅ VLAN Implementation for Network Segmentation
- ✅ Guest and Admin Wireless Networks
- ✅ Static and Dynamic Routing
- ✅ Switch and Router Configuration
- ✅ Hotel Website Hosted Internally
- ✅ End-to-End Connectivity Verification using Ping, Web, FTP

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Networking Protocols**: DHCP, DNS, HTTP, FTP, VLAN, RIP
- **Devices**: Routers, Switches, Wireless Routers, PCs, Servers

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the `.pkt` file.
2. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer** (v8.0 or above recommended).
3. Load the file and start simulation mode.
4. Use CLI/GUI to test pings, web pages, and VLAN traffic separation.

## 🔐 Network Design Goals

- Enhance security using VLANs
- Provide both wired and wireless access
- Ensure availability of core hotel services (FTP, Web)
- Separate guest and administrative traffic
- Enable future scalability for more rooms/floors
